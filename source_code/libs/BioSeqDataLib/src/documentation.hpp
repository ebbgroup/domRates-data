/**
 *
 * \mainpage
 *
 * The BioSeqDataLib (BSDL) has been developed to provide an easy access to biological data. Its main focus is on domain data however it 
 * contains several classes to deal with other (mainly sequence) data.
 *
 *  ## Modules
 *  The BSDL currently consists of three main modules taking care of three areas of Bioinformatics.
 * 
 *  ### Sequence module
 * 
 *  The sequence module contains mainly classes and functions that are related to reading, writing and analysing sequence data. A range of 
 *  different Input formats are currently supported.
 * 
 *  ### Domain module
 * 
 *  The domain module contains classes and functions to reading and writing of domain data. A range of 
 *  different Input formats are currently supported.
 * 
 *  ### Phylogeny module
 * 
 *  The phylogeny module provides a class to read a phylogenetic tree and allows to traverse it in different ways.
