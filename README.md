The modular nature of protein evolution: Domain rearrangement rates across eukaryotic life - data archive
=========

This archive contains all files necessary for or showing the results of analyses for "The modular nature of protein evolution: Domain rearrangement rates across eukaryotic life" 
by Elias Dohmen, Steffen Klasberg, Erich Bornberg-Bauer, SÃ¶ren Perrey and Carsten Kemena

The following directories contain the described files:

DomRates_results 
------------
DomRates result files for all five analysed eukaryotic clades. 
- *.frequencies.txt lists the total numbers and percentage of all event and solution types 
- *stats.txt lists the number of events per node in the tree 
- *stats_epd.txt lists all inferred events with information about the node, solution type and event type as well as the ancestral arrangement

figs
------------ 
Figures used in the paper as vector graphics/in high resolution plus overview figures for all analysed phylogenetic trees with according Node-IDs (ids_tree).
 
GOterm-enrichment-analysis
------------
All enriched GOterms for the five eukaryotic clades and specific nodes described in the paper. 
Additionally, files are provided that contain the universe (u) and all gained arrangements of interest (goi) used for the topGO enrichment analysis.
 
jackknife_test 
------------
All subsampled trees used for the jackknife test described in the paper and the corresponding DomRates result files.
  
source_code
------------
DomRates source code in the version used for the analysis presented in the paper.
